SST-r and SST-K function plots (Fig 1) can be found in SST_functions.R.

Importing and cleaning the CMIP6 data can be found in CMIP6_Data.R.

Baseline nonspatial model to determine optimal fishing level (Figure S2) can be found in MSY_Calculations.R.

Thermal effects model runs on their own (Figure S3) can be found in SST_models.R.

The code to generate the complete Figure 3 is in Figure3_allpanels.R.

The code to generate Figure 3A and Figure 4 can be found in SST_MPA_Fishing_Relative_to_Baseline.R. These are the figures that are relative to the baseline model.

The code to generate Figures 3B, 3C, Figure SX, and Figure 5 can be found in SST_MPA_Fishing.R. These are the figures that are relative to the optimal nonspatial fishing effort level.

The code to generate Figures S4-S5 can be found in SST_MPA_SiteFidel.R.
